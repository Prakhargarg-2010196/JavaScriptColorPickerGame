# JavaScriptColorPickerGame
This is a fun game I built during a hackathon assessment.

This is a color-choosing game based in vanilla html,css and javascript.
## Instruction to play the game 
1. A Color code is given at the top in the header in RGB() format and also has a background of the color picked in the last attempt.
2. Below there are color pallettes given from which you can choose from the correct color
  1. If you choose the correct color all the colors are converted into same color and the grid is complete again.
  2. If you choose wrong color that pallete vanishes.
3. There are two modes in this game one is easy and other is hard , easy has 3 boxes in pallete and hard has 6 boxes in pallete to choose from.

## Things I learnt while building it 
First of I struggled a lot while building this game as I struggled with vanilla js and DOM manipulation in this project so these are the things I learnt while building the 
project
- Vanilla JS
- RGB color structure
- DOM manipulation
- Usage of Random function
- Usage of flexbox/grid

## Things I would like to improve in this project 
1. Object oriented code instead of functional code
2. Usage of Proper design patterns.
